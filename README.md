## Citation
`fastheatmap` is the high performance computing server of `shinyheatmap`.  If you are using `fastheatmap` in your work, please cite the `shinyheatmap` paper (http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0176334) accordingly:

## Future plans

- [x] Outperform all state-of-the-art heatmap software (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0176334.g004)
- [x] Retain the (comfortable) lead
- [ ] Add high performance hierarchical clustering
- [ ] Add an anchor view (having a "satellite" view when zooming in would be of a great help.  In CytoscapeWeb or Cytoscape network visualization tools for example when users zoom in/out there is always a small window showing the big picture of the network at its higher level and a rectangle highlighting the region where users zoomed in).
